# Source Code for Experiments: Designing for Engagement Thesis

This repository contains the source code for the three experiments conducted as part of the Master's thesis titled "Designing for Engagement: An Affordance-Based Model for Interactive Screens to trigger user driven actions in Self-Service Restaurants."

The research explores how interactive screens can be designed to effectively engage users and influence behavior in public self-service restaurant (SSR) environments. The experiments were conducted at Flavoria, a university self-service restaurant in Turku, Finland, and progressively increased in interaction complexity.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders, each corresponding to one of the experiments detailed in the thesis:

*   **/Experiment 1**: Contains the source code and assets for the Rush Information Screen (Passive Communication).
*   **/Experiment 2**: Contains the source code and assets for the Intentions Poll (Active Communication).
*   **/Experiment 3**: Contains the source code and assets for the Food Waste Pledge (Two-Way Communication).

Each experiment folder includes its own `Readme.md` file providing specific details about the setup, technologies used, and how to run or understand the code for that particular experiment.

## Experiment Overviews

### Experiment 1: Rush Information Screen (Passive Communication)

*   **Objective**: To influence diner behavior (specifically, to encourage earlier arrival times) without requiring direct interaction, by displaying estimated wait times and suggesting less busy periods.
*   **Communication Type**: Passive.
*   **Key Metric**: Shift in the proportion of diners arriving during the early lunch slot.
*   **Details**: See the `Readme.md` file in the `/Experiment 1` folder.

### Experiment 2: Intentions Poll (Active Communication)

*   **Objective**: To gauge diner intentions for the day (e.g., "Are you eating at Flavoria today?") via a simple tappable interface, aiming to improve demand forecasting.
*   **Communication Type**: Active (simple polling).
*   **Key Metric**: Daily interaction rate (percentage of diners interacting).
*   **Details**: See the `Readme.md` file in the `/Experiment 2` folder.

### Experiment 3: Food Waste Pledge (Two-Way Communication)

*   **Objective**: To encourage a reduction in food waste by inviting users to make a pledge (e.g., to take only as much bread as they could eat) using a two-step interactive process with social proof elements.
*   **Communication Type**: Two-Way (interactive pledge).
*   **Key Metrics**: Initial interaction rate and pledge completion rate.
*   **Details**: See the `Readme.md` file in the `/Experiment 3` folder.

## Thesis Context

These experiments form the empirical basis for validating the affordance-based design model proposed in the thesis. For a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical background, model development, experimental design, results, and discussion, please refer to the full thesis document.
