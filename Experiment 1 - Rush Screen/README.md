# Experiment 1: Rush Information Screen (Passive Communication)

A real-time lunch rush monitoring system for Flavoria restaurant at the University of Turku. This application helps diners plan their lunch breaks by providing current wait times and recommending optimal dining periods. For the purpose of the research, *real-time* updates here refers to wait time values defined in the code based on historical data.

This repository contains the source code for the Experiment 1 conducted as part of my Master's thesis titled "Designing for Engagement: An Affordance-Based Model for Interactive Screens to trigger user driven actions in Self-Service Restaurants."

*   **Objective**: To influence diner behavior (specifically, to encourage earlier arrival times) without requiring direct interaction, by displaying estimated wait times and suggesting less busy periods.
*   **Communication Type**: Passive.
*   **Key Metric**: Shift in the proportion of diners arriving during the early or late lunch slot.
