# Experiment 3: Food Waste Pledge (Two-Way Communication)

An interactive web application designed to raise awareness about food waste and encourage mindful consumption habits. Users can interact with food items through a unique slicing mechanic and make pledges to reduce food waste.

This repository contains the source code for the Experiment 2 conducted as part of my Master's thesis titled "Designing for Engagement: An Affordance-Based Model for Interactive Screens to trigger user driven actions in Self-Service Restaurants."
